Our Land and Water -- Interoperable Modelling

Repository for code developed under the programme for interoperable models sponsored by Our Land and Water.

This programme aims to develop a modelling system populated with models which draws on national datasets and is implemented in an interoperable modelling framework.

This repository contains code developed to link models for the programme, but for most cases does not house the models themselves. 

Tools in use for the integration framework include Delta Shell and BMI. Delta Shell is an open-source modeling framework developed by Deltares, a water and subsurface research institute in the Netherlands, and used to deliver their Flexible Mesh suite and a number of other products. BMI is the Basic Model Interface, defined by the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) project, which describes itself as an "international and community-driven effort to transform the science and practice of earth-surface dynamics modeling.
