## Contents

- **Muskingum** -- A feature-based model (i.e. one that uses lumped methods, rather than grids or meshes) that translates and attenuates flow hydrographs down channels. Implemented as a console application two ways: one using a library directly, the second using BMI.
- **TypologyLookup** -- A lookup table providing N and P loads for various typologies. Contains a core library, a BMI-wrapped version of the library and two example executables using the wrapped and non-wrapped libraries. Uses CMake as build tool.
