- **Muskingum** -- A feature-based model (i.e. one that uses lumped methods, rather than grids or meshes) that translates and attenuates flow hydrographs down channels. Implemented as a console application two ways: one using a library directly, the second using BMI.
- **Lookup** -- A small library to map inputs to outputs according to rules defined in a YAML config file.
- **HelloDimr** -- A simple demonstration of the use of BMI, as implemented in DIMR, to pass data and control between two programs. An intermediate file (in YAML format) is used to pass a string and an array, which are not handled by DIMR, between the two programs.
- **LumassBMI** -- A sample application and two sample models demonstrating the use of the BMI-compatible LUMASS engine to run geospatial processing and optimisation models.
