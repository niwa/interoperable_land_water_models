## LumassBMI

- **Ecotopes** -- A configurable LUMASS model for creating ecotopes from input shapefiles
and continous raster files. In its current configuration, the model can handle up to ten different input layers.
- **Optimisation** -- A sample data set and sample optimisation scenario files for the Aparima catchment to reproduce the results presented in the "Interoperable Modelling - Spatial Economic Optimisation" report.
- **src** -- Source code of a sample application (LumassBMITest) that invokes an arbitrary LUMASS model using the BMI interface.
